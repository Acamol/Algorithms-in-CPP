  More information about shortest path problem can be found here:

  And Bellman-Ford algorithm:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellmanâ€“Ford_algorithm

  Bellman-Ford algorithm is essentially an example of dynamic programming.
  It can be shown that after the i-th "round" all shortest paths with i edges
  are correct. Like Dijkstra's algorithm, it uses "Relaxation", but also
  allows negative weights, and even can detect a negative-weight cycle.

  This implementation returns an empty graph once a negative-weight cycle has
  been detected, but with a small change it is possible to assign each vertex
  its correct distance, including the vertices which are arbitrary far.
